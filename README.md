# 30 Days DevOps Challenge - Weather Dashboard
 
 Day 1: Building a weather data collection system using AWS S3 and OpenWeather API

## Weather Data Collection System - DevOps Day 1 Challenge
### Project Overview
This project is a Weather Data Collection System that demonstrates core DevOps principles by combining:

 - **External API Integration** (OpenWeather API)
- **Cloud Storage** (AWS S3)
- **Infrastructure as Code**
- **Version Control** (Git)
- **Python Development**
- **Error Handling**
- **Environment Management**
### Features
- Fetches real-time weather data for multiple cities
- Displays temperature (Â°F), humidity, and weather conditions
- Automatically stores weather data in AWS S3
- Supports multiple cities tracking
- Timestamps all data for historical tracking

## What I Learned

- AWS S3 bucket creation and management
- Environment variable management for secure API keys
- Python best practices for API integration
- Git workflow for project development**
- Error handling in distributed systems
- Cloud resource management
## Future Enhancements
- Add weather forecasting
- Implement data visualization
- Add more cities
- Create automated testing
- Set up CI/CD pipeline
## How to navigate all of it as a beginner
### Prerequisites
Before you can work on the project, you need to have certain things setup on your local machine. This includes but not limited to the following:
- **VS code Editor** you can see documentation <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download" target="_blank">here</a>
- **AWS CLI** Installed you can see documentation <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html" target="_blank">here</a>

Next, you configure your AWS CLI with the ACCESS KEY ID and ACCESS SECRET KEY gotten from your AWS console IAM USER by doing:
```bash
aws configure
```
## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aminatanimashaun31/weather-dashboard.git
```
2. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Configure environment variables (.env):
```bash
OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key
AWS_BUCKET_NAME=your_bucket_name
```
4. Run the application
```bash
python src/weather_dashboard.py
```
